## üîß Usage

Using `dot_connect` is intuitive and straightforward.

### Getting Things Set Up

Before you begin, you can configure your environment variables by using a `.env` file or an alternative method. Additionally, you can utilize default authorization patterns supported by your chosen backend. `dot-connect` will prioritize credentials that are present in a `.env` file.

Below are step-by-step examples of how you can connect and query various backends:

#### Snowflake

```python
import dot_connect

con = dot_connect.snowflake.connect()
print(con.cursor().execute("SELECT 1;").fetchall())
```

#### Snowpark
```python
import dot_connect

con = dot_connect.snowpark.connect()
con.sql("SELECT 1").show()
```

#### MySQL
```python
import dot_connect

con = dot_connect.mysql.connect()
cursor = con.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
result = cursor.fetchall()
print(result)
```

#### PostgreSQL
```python
import dot_connect

con = dot_connect.postgres.connect()
cursor = con.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
result = cursor.fetchall()
print(result)
```
